# my personal .dotfiles

Currently a very minimal version control of my dotfiles. Keep in mind that my main system runs arch and hyprland and I did not port everything to macOS or windows / WSL.

My more complex dotfiles got their own repos: 
- [nvim](https://github.com/appleseedexm/nvim)
- [hyprland](https://github.com/appleseedexm/hypr)
- [ironbar](https://github.com/appleseedexm/ironbar)
- *deprecated* [i3](https://github.com/appleseedexm/i3)
